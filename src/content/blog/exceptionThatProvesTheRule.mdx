title: 'Exception that proves the rule'

One of the reasons that I wanted to start this blog was to have a place where I could document
phrases that are used to mean one thing but mean a completely different thing when you learn more
context about them, because there seems to be quite a few of those phrases in English.

Most recently, last month I skimmed a [thread on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41445790)
discussing an article about physics and mathematics, but for me the most interesting comment in that thread was
[this digression](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41448882):

<blockquote cite="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41448882">
Interesting linguistic aside: "the exception that proves the rule" makes use of this more old fashioned
use of prove, to test. So it's the exceptional case that tests the rule.
</blockquote>

...and thereby proves the rule false.

The [Wikipedia page for the phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_that_proves_the_rule) sites
1918's [The Style Book of the Detroit News](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/32997/pg32997-images.html):

<blockquote cite="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/32997/pg32997-images.html">
The exception proves the rule is a phrase that arises from ignorance, though common to good writers. The
original word was preuves, which did not mean proves but tests.
</blockquote>

The claim is roughly corroborated by [Etymonline's page about "prove"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/prove):

<blockquote cite="https://www.etymonline.com/word/prove">
c. 1200, prÄ“ven, pruven, proven "to try by experience or by a test or standard; evaluate; demonstrate in practice," from
Old French prover, pruver "show; convince; put to the test" (11c., Modern French prouver)
</blockquote>

So if your rule has an exception that proves the rule, then you do not have a rule. Unless your exception turns out
not to actually be an exception after all, but that would be the exception that proves the rule.
