A few days ago,
[an article about recent Australian politics](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-12/tourette-lobster-diplomacy-hamas-economy-difficult-week-politics/104461710)
opened stunningly uncharitably towards a Liberal Party politican named [Paul Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fletcher_(politician)):

<blockquote cite="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-12/tourette-lobster-diplomacy-hamas-economy-difficult-week-politics/104461710">
Paul Fletcher is not known for cracking the funnies.

More of an éminence grise, the Liberal frontbencher makes wallpaper seem lively.
</blockquote>

[Cambridge Dictionary defines "éminence grise"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eminence-grise) as:

<blockquote cite="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eminence-grise">
someone without an official position who has power or influence over rulers or people who make decisions
</blockquote>

Although [Merriam-Webster gives a kinder gloss](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/%C3%A9minence%20grise):

<blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/%C3%A9minence%20grise">
a respected authority
</blockquote>

I find it unlikely that the term was used in this kinder sense, given the context of making "wallpaper seem lively".

I have no particular like or dislike for Paul Fletcher, but to me the accusation of being "without an official position" reads as a
bizarre criticism of someone who is an elected reperesentative, has held numerous ministerial positions and is currently the
[Manager of Opposition Business](https://www.paulfletcher.com.au/media-releases/fletcher-welcomes-shadow-cabinet-appointment).

If I really, really tried to be understanding, I could buy that the article's author used "éminence grise" in
[the sense that Wikipedia defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89minence_grise):

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89minence_grise">
a powerful decision-maker or adviser who operates "behind the scenes", or in a non-public or unofficial capacity.
</blockquote>

"Non-public" would be doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sense, as you would have to argue that Fletcher is
"non-public" because he doesn't do as many press conferences as, say, the leader of his party.
