Lately I've been toying with the idea of casually attempting to learn Latin. To that end I recently stumbled upon a
YouTube playlist called [Easy Latin Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjqqMkeHFt1E_lRi9nQvtmP9Od2JokI1J).

The first video in that series, while teaching the Latin word "docet" ("he teaches"), remarks that the
word is "easy to remember if you know what a docent is".

According to [Meriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/docent), a "docent" is:

<blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/docent">
what Americans would call an associate professorâ€”that is, a college or university teacher who has been given tenure but
hasn't yet achieved the rank of full professor. But in the U.S. a docent is a guide who works at a
museum, a historical site, or even a zoo or a park.
</blockquote>

What intrigues me is that the association between teaching and "docent" makes much more sense for the non-US definition of
the word, yet the creator of Easy Latin Lesons has an American accent. I am also left to wonder what is the
most accurate Latin translation of "he tour-guides".
