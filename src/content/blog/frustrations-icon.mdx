title: 'Frustrations Encountered While Attempting to Generate a Favicon'

This post focuses on the final set of changes that I deemed necessary to place the blog in a usable state.

My struggle to make one of these changes was more amusing than the others.
(I'm talking about creating the favicon.)

## Home page and posts index

The home page now shows the three most recent posts in reverse chronological order. (Of course, at this
stage there only are three posts.) While usable, the home page is not yet finished, because ultimately I only
want to render post previews on the home page, not the whole posts. This is because I don't
want the home page to be overly long.

The posts index currently shows one row per post in chronological order. For now I think that chronological order makes
more sense for a blog like this one where each post builds on the last. Previously the posts index worked as
it currently does, although it looked broken before its current styling.

## Favicon

With the home page functional, the blog was usable. And yet, an issue remained.

Because I had no favicon, the blog was producing an HTTP 500 error. If I wanted to eliminate this error, I would need a favicon.

Unfortunately, I am no artist. Fortunately, we live in the AI boom. All I should have to do is search the web for
"AI favicon generator" and surely a decent solution would present itself. Right?

My idea for a beautiful, distinctive icon for the site was a fleuron that incorporated the initials of the blog's title. So I
opened up my first search result, veed.io, and supplied my prompt. The result was underwhelming.

On reflection, I shouldn't have been surprised that I was given an "f" instead of a "P", as it is
now well known that AIs are incompetent at spelling.

Next, I attempted to Use AppyPie's favicon generator. I entered my prompt...

...and clicked "Generate", at which point I was met with...

...a login screen. I didn't wish to sign up for a service that I was going to use once, so I moved on.

My final attempt at getting AI to prove itself was FaviCraft's generator.

I began entering my selections and scrolled down, expecting to find a "Generate" button.

Instead, I found a "Sign In" button. I was tricked and the tricksters didn't even need a redirect; they just hid the twist below the fold!

So I gave up on attempting to use an AI favicon generator. Funnily enough, one of my initial search results was [favicon.io](favicon.io) which didn't
even meet the "AI" part of my search criteria, but it's exactly the service that I ended up using to make my icon.

It's not an amazing icon, but it's perfectly serviceable.

## Images

This is my first post that uses images. The image of the console error, although centred, initially looked unaligned to my eyes.
To compensate, I [once again](/blog/basic-styling) cracked open [Ferdy Christant's colour palette](https://ferdychristant.com/color-for-the-color-challenged-884c7aa04a56)
and picked out another grey, this time to demarcate the text of the blog by setting the `html` element to use a different colour than
the `body` element, which now makes it clearer where images live in relation to the sides of the text.

## Death of the "To do" heading

On an unrelated note, in previous posts I wrapped up with a section entitled "To do", but something about the casing of the
heading looked off to me. I wondered if I had misremembered the advice that headings within a piece of writing should
use sentence case rather than title case, but a brief check around the web appeared to confirm my understanding.
I now suspect that the reason "To do" looked weird to me is because it is an infinitive verb, whereas all of my
other headings are noun phrases, so I'll be sticking to using noun phrases as my headings going forward.

## Things to do

* The home page should not render full posts.
* Posts should display estimated reading times and progress bars.
* Post headings should be hyperlinks to URLs with fragments.
* Post footers should have next and previous buttons.
* The site should be audited for accessibility.
