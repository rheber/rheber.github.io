Recently I was pondering the oddness of using the phrase "not bad" to indirectly say "good". I was sure that there was a
name for this type of language but I couldn't remember it. So I looked up the phrase "not bad", which led me to
[a Stack Exchange comment](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/104475/interpreting-not-bad#comment212855_104475)
with the advice to "Read up on litotes".

Litotes, according to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/litotes), is:

<blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/litotes">
understatement in which an affirmative is expressed by the negative of the contrary (as in "not a bad singer" or "not unhappy")
</blockquote>

Going forward I hope this word won't not be unhard to remember.
