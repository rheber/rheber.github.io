Today's edition of [The New York Times' Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands) turned out to be themed around
group words like "swarm" and "colony". One of those words was "knot".

[Britannica defines a "knot"](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/knot) as:

<blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/knot">
a group of people who are standing or sitting close together
</blockquote>

So a group of people social distancing would not be a knot, but they could be a knot if they're not doing that.
