One of Marginalia's [Fragments of the Old Web](https://www.marginalia.nu/links/fragments-old-web/)
is a small site called [Ragged Entelechy](http://www.oceanstar.com/) by Fiona Webster. From the site:

<blockquote cite="http://www.oceanstar.com/">An entelechy is that which realizes or makes actual,
what is otherwise merely potential.</blockquote>

[Britannica's entelechy page](https://www.britannica.com/topic/entelechy) seems to explain it as the thing which which turns the
physical matter of a human or a chair or so on into the complete, realised human or chair or so on, like a "soul".

Judging from the Britannica page, "entelechy" probably isn't a word which is generally usable outside of
Aristotelian metaphysics, although I do wonder if, for example, pushing a boulder down a hill and converting its
potential energy to kinetic energy makes you that energy's entelechy.
