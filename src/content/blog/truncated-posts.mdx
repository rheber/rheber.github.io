title: 'Truncated Posts and More Rehype Shenanigans'

I finally got around to making my home page only show truncated versions of the blog's last few posts. But first, I found a
couple more Rehype plugins to give me easy wins.

## Subheading Links

I first sought to attach icons to the subheadings in my posts that would link to URL fragments. My initial attempt at
implementing the [`rehype-autolink-headings`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings) plugin didn't appear to
do anything until I found a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/5001#issuecomment-1270723522) that
pointed out that I would also need the `rehype-slug` plugin.

With both plugins installed, an empty link now rendered beside each subheading. All that remained was to fill and
style the links. For now I've decided against the pattern of hiding the links until being hovered over, a pattern which I've
noticed some sites use, but which I dislike because always showing the link makes it immediately obvious that the link exists.

## Tables of Contents

The GitHub issue for my subheading links problem pointed me to the
[Astro markdown documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#markdown-plugins), which noted that
there was a Remark plugin for generating tables of contents. So I tried it and...it did nothing.

And then I found a [Rehype plugin for tables of contents](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/rehype-toc). Which worked for me.
So I really hope I don't have to think too hard about the distinction between Rehype and Remark for the duration of this
blog because clearly I'm mising something.

The plugin rendered TOCs not just on the individual post pages but also on the home page, and I couldn't see options for either the
plugin itself or the Astro configuration more generally to target only the post pages specifically, so I simply set the TOCs on the
home page to have the style `display: none;`.

## Truncated Posts

With those changes done, I turned my attention to truncating posts on the home page, a change that I felt was
absolutely necessary as I personally have a distaste both for blogs which render whole posts on their home page as well as
blogs that don't render any post text at all on their home page.

A brief web search turned up no plugins for truncating posts. I could find a couple of blog posts on the topic by
[Paul Scanlon](https://www.paulie.dev/posts/2023/09/how-to-create-excerpts-with-astro) and
[Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/blog/creating-excerpts-in-astro/) but neither appeared to achieve the effect that I wanted.

I realised that all I really wanted to do was to cut off the post body after the first one or two paragraphs, before the
post's first `h2` heading. So I wrote a Typescript function to do that:

```typescript
const removeElementsFromFirstH2 = (article: string) => {
	const re = /(##.*)/gs;
	return article.replace(re, "");
};
```

And then I attempted to reassign the `body` attributes of each post before calling `post.render()`.

Which didn't work. So I now suspect that the `body` attribute is read-only.

This left me with a problem: I needed to figure out how I would render the truncated posts. The Astro docs' Markdown page that
I had earlier consulted suggested the `marked` package for rendering remote Markdown, which ended up solving my problem.

But it's becoming increasingly clear that Astro was not initially designed with Markdown and MDX in mind. I've been enjoying
Astro so far, but I have to wonder how I would reduce my friction with the framework if I had to use it for a production
project, because from the perspective of MDX, Astro still has some pretty rough edges.
