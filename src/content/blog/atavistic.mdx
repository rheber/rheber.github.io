Ed West's post [A language of beautiful impurity](https://www.edwest.co.uk/p/a-language-of-beautiful-impurity) renewed my curiosity about
Anglish, the effort to replace English's words of Latin and Greek origin with Germanic words.

Ironically, among West's praise for Anglish, the word that caught my attention was a Latinate one.

<blockquote cite="https://www.edwest.co.uk/p/a-language-of-beautiful-impurity">
Anglo-Saxon language can also have more emotional, atavistic appeal.
</blockquote>

[Merriam-Webster defines "atavism"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atavistic) as:


<blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atavistic">
recurrence of or reversion to a past style, manner, outlook, approach, or activity
</blockquote>

This strikes me as quite a broad definition. It suggests that wearing armour and riding a horse into battle would be
atavistic, but so would sucking your thumb and crawling into the foetal position.
