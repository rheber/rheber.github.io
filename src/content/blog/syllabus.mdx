I had only known the word "syllabus" from its usage in education, where it is roughly
synonymous with "curriculum". From [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/syllabus):

<blockquote cite="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/syllabus">
(a plan showing) the subjects or books to be studied in a particular course, especially a course that leads to an exam
</blockquote>

However, this week I learned of the legal definition of "syllabus" as the blog Techdirt published
[a post about the First Amendment](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/10/02/on-fires-theaters-and-censorship-neither-vice-presidential-candidate-understands-free-speech)
which linked to a couple of pages about court cases, and some those pages had a "syllabus" link in their sidebar, which each linked to
a list of legal findings.

[Miriam Webster defines "syllabus"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syllabus) as the sense of "headnote" that means:

<blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/headnote">
a note prefixed to the report of a decided legal case
</blockquote>

The American Heritage Dictionary features a [slightly different definition](https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=syllabus):

<blockquote cite="https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=syllabus">
A summary or abstract of the legal rulings contained in a published judicial case opinion.
</blockquote>

I can only assume that every lawyer has to learn this definition in law school. It would be a shame to leave it off the syllabus.
