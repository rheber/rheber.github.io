Minor changeset. I adapted [Silo Creative's reading progress bar](https://www.silocreativo.com/en/time-progress-bar-css/) to
add a reading progress bar at the top of my posts. The advantage of this particular implementation is that it
doesn't require Javascript, but currently the text of the posts is layered over the progress bar instead of underneath,
which I'll have to address at some point.
