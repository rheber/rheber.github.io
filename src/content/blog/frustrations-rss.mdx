title: 'Frustrations Encountered While Attempting to Configure an RSS Feed'
pubDate: 'Jul 25 2024'

This post focuses on my efforts to set up an RSS feed for the blog. The Astro docs feature several mentions of RSS, so I
figured that this would be a straightforward process.

It was not a straightforward process.

## Technically Working Feed

As it turns out, the default Astro project already comes with an `rss.xml.js` file that generates an RSS feed:

```javascript
import rss from '@astrojs/rss';
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { SITE_TITLE, SITE_DESCRIPTION } from '../consts';

export async function GET(context) {
	const posts = await getCollection('blog');
	return rss({
		title: SITE_TITLE,
		description: SITE_DESCRIPTION,
		site: context.site,
		items: posts.map((post) => ({
			...post.data,
			link: `/blog/${post.slug}/`,
		})),
	});
}
```

For some reason though, the `head` tag of the default Astro project does not link to the generated RSS file, so the
link must be added manually:

```html
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/rss.xml" title="Slow Progress">
```

Upon loading this feed into my RSS reader, I was surprised to see no content.

The default RSS generator does not add the content of the posts to the RSS items.

## Feed Content

To figure out how to get my content into my feed, I consulted the [Astro RSS documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss).
Simple, all that needed to be done was to supply the `content` parameter for each item.

Merely getting the post body as is would be insufficient, because the posts are written in Markdown rather than HTML, and the
RSS feed needs the rendered HTML. Not to worry, because Markdown posts have a `compiledContent()` method.

While trying to work out why `compiledContent()` was not working from me, I discovered from
a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/10604) that Astro's RSS documentation was out of date at the
time of this post, as it referenced a method called `glob` which is now deprecated. But if I had read the docs closer,
I would have noticed this beauty:

<blockquote cite="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss">Note: this feature is not supported for MDX files.</blockquote>

I would have liked this information at the start of the page. The page featured various coloured callouts,
including one marked "Caution". No callout for this, though.

So I needed to figure out how I would get my rendered MDX files into my feed. Fortunately, the GitHub issue linked to a
[GitHub roadmap discussion](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/discussions/419#discussioncomment-9861812)
with a comment that lead me to a solution. The code's not pretty but it works. So now I have a working RSS feed.

## Code Blocks

I decided that I wanted to include some code blocks in this post. Right now, the styling of these posts is completely default.
I think this styling fits in well enough with the rest of the blog for now, but I anticipate having to change at least part of it.
At a minimum my `code` and `pre` tags should probably have the same background colour. But to do that it looks like I'll have to
investigate the Astro docs further, and I've had my fill for now.

## Gradually Improving Content

The unexpected benefit of having an RSS feed is that the content is purely HTML, stripping away all the styling that I have
been crafting. As a result, If I want my posts to look good in an RSS reader, I'll need to think about how the posts will look good without styling.
In my first post I went out of my way to add end marks to my posts, but they're not in my content so they're not in my feed.

I suppose I'll have to try to write definitive endings from now on.
