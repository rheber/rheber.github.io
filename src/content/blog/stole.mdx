Today's [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) featured the category "DRAPED ACCESSORIES",
which contained the item "STOLE".

From [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stole):

<blockquote cite="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stole">
a long, narrow piece of cloth, especially silk, worn over the shoulders by
some priests in the Christian Church during religious ceremonies
</blockquote>

The [Wikipedia page for "stole"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stole_(vestment)) links to numerous
other religious garments with unusual names. I do not plan to write about them all.
