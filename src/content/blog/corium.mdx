A few days ago I saw this meme:

![Top: Some text from the Wikipedia page for Elephant's Foot. "The Elephant's Foot is the nickname given to a
large mass of corium formed during the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986. The mass is quite dense, unyielding to a
drill, but able to be damaged by a Kalashnikov rifle." Bottom: A photo of
Dave Chappelle captioned "Soviet problems require Soviet solutions".](/blog/corium.jpg)

"Corium" is [defined by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corium_(nuclear_reactor)) as:

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corium_(nuclear_reactor)">
a material that is created in a nuclear reactor core during a nuclear meltdown accident. Resembling lava in
consistency, it consists of a mixture of nuclear fuel, fission products, control rods, structural materials from the
affected parts of the reactor, products of their chemical reaction with air, water, steam, and in the event that the
reactor vessel is breached, molten concrete from the floor of the reactor room.
</blockquote>

This appears to be quite a specialised definition, as several other online dictionaries lack a gloss for this sense of
the word "corium". The most common definition I could find for "corium" is that it is the name for a particular layer of the skin.

Despite the Elephant Foot's initial toughness, it appears to
have [mellowed out over the years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant%27s_Foot_(Chernobyl)):

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant%27s_Foot_(Chernobyl)">
By June 1998, the outer layers had started turning to dust and the mass had started to crack, as the
radioactive components were starting to disintegrate to a point where the structural integrity of the
glass was failing. In 2021, the mass was described as having a consistency similar to sand.
</blockquote>

So all we needed to do was to wait a few decades for the mass to disintegrate. Which, when you think about it,
is a Soviet solution in its own way.
