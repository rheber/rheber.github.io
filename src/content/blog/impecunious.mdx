[(pronunciation)](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/impecunious)

Bruce Lehrman was once [described by his lawyer as probably "Australia's most hated
man"](https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/bruce-lehrmann-probably-australia-s-most-hated-man-his-lawyer-20241014-p5ki1u).

His haters surely would have been pleased if they saw
[this ABC recent article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-23/act-live-bruce-lehrmann-appeal-judgment/104503470):

<blockquote cite="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-23/act-live-bruce-lehrmann-appeal-judgment/104503470">
The Federal Court has previously heard Mr Lehrmann is "impecunious" and is unable to pay a
security for the costs Network Ten will incur in opposing the appeal.
</blockquote>

[Cambridge Dictionary defines "impecunious"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/impecunious) as
"having very little money". Presumably that lack of money is why [Channel Seven paid $4000 a fortnight for Lehrman's
rent](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-05/bruce-lehrmann-rent-seven-paying-4000-per-fortnight-court-told/103192898).
