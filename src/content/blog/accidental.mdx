In today's edition of [The New York Times' Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections), one of the categories was
"FOUND ON SHEET MUSIC", which included the word "ACCIDENTAL".

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_(music)):

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_(music)">
an accidental is a symbol that indicates an alteration of a given pitch. The most common accidentals are the
flat (♭) and the sharp (♯), which represent alterations of a semitone, and the natural (♮), which cancels a sharp or flat.
</blockquote>

According to [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/accidental), the etymology of this usage of "accidental",
which is the same as the etymology of the common sense of "accidental", is the Latin "accidentalis" referring to
a "non-essential quality".

<blockquote cite="https://www.etymonline.com/word/accidental">
The musical sense is from 1868; so called because they alter the note without essentially changing the key of the passage.
</blockquote>

Moreover, "a nonessential property" is itself one of the additional
senses defined by [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accidental). Which suggests that, for example, one could
describe good writing as an accidental of an action film.
