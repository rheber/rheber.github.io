Today I saw a [thread on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41855006) discussing an article about the company Palantir.
[This comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41864534) caught my attention:

I read the article. It sounds like a Laudatio to amorality for a S&P500 behemoth whose goal is to
enable other companies to purge human from their workflow, pardon... to digitalize the business.

According to [lsd.law](https://www.lsd.law/define/laudatio), a "laudatio" is:

<blockquote cite="https://www.lsd.law/define/laudatio">
a type of testimony given in ancient Roman courts to speak about a person's good behavior and honesty. It's
like when people speak nicely about someone in a modern trial to show that they are a
good person. The plural form of laudatio is laudationes.
</blockquote>

It sounds to me that if you're in need of a laudatio, you're not having a good day.
