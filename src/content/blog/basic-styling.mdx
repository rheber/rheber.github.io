This post mainly focuses on the preliminary styling choices I've made for the blog.

These choices have been heavily influenced by the post
[Visual design rules you can safely follow every time](https://anthonyhobday.com/sideprojects/saferules/) by Anthony Hobday.
While that post has many great specific tips, my biggest takeaway might be its most general tip: that every design choice
should be deliberate.

## Colours

I like the black-and-white aesthetic, as I feel that its minimality contributes to legibility, so I have mostly applied
that aesthetic here while following the general advice to not use pure black and white.

For hyperlinks, the default browser behaviour is that unvisited links display as a bright blue and visited links display as a
bright purple, colours which do not appeal to me. However, Anthony Hobday's blog, as well as aesthetically similar sites such
as [Gwern Branwen's site](https://gwern.net/index), minimise the use of colour on hyperlinks altogether. I don't want to
throw away the information conveyed by the colours, I just want to select nicer colours.

Fortunately the post [Color for the Color-challenged](https://ferdychristant.com/color-for-the-color-challenged-884c7aa04a56)
by Ferdy Chrstant features a ready-to-use colour palette. I've styled the various states of a hyperlink using shades from
the red band of that palette. I've also selected a nice green and black for the text and background colours of my code tags,
which uncoloured did not appear very differentiated from the main text.

## Spacing

Any fixed pixel amounts are currently multiples of four, and the current spacings feel about right.

For body width, I'm trying out a `min-width` of 360px and a `max-width` of 60% which seems to look decent for
both wide and narrow viewports.

## Typography

For the moment I've chosen two fonts which address my main concern of legibility,
[Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fontsource.org/fonts/atkinson-hyperlegible) as my main font and
[Monaspace Neon](https://fontsource.org/fonts/monaspace-neon) as my code font.

Right now I'm not using any heading tags smaller than `h2`, so for now I'll assume that I won't be doing so in the
near future. Thus I've styled my `h2` text to be just a little bigger than my `p` text, with my `h1` text being my biggest text.

## Header

I've tried to style the navigation header to take up as little vertical room as necessary while being usable.

## Dialect

This isn't a styling concern but it's something I had to consider when I began writing this post. When I write code I try to
stick to American English for consistency with other codebases, but as this is my blog I shall
use my natural British English. This is a choice I was forced to confront as soon as I typed the word "Colours",
although I had softly made the choice in the previous post upon writing the word "specialising".

## To do

* I'm still yet to make my home page functional. I don't love my posts index either, but I think I'll fix both things at the same time.

* Estimated reading times and progress bars.

* I feel like blog posts need footers. I want headings to be hyperlinks to a URLs with fragments, which I might then use with "Back to top" links.
