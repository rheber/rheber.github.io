title: 'Estimated Reading Times (or, Remark and Rehype Are Two Different Things)'
pubDate: 'Aug 1 2024'

I checked the Astro docs to see if they contained walkthroughs for any of my planned features.
There's a whole page called [Community Educational Content](https://docs.astro.build/en/community-resources/content/) which
contained a few things that I wanted to implement, and this post focuses on them.

## Reading Times

First on the agenda was estimated reading times. I had figured that in the worst case I would need to calculate these manually, by
counting the amount of words in each post and dividing by the average adult
reading speed. <a id="estimated-reading-footnote-1-ref" href="#estimated-reading-footnote-1">[1]</a>

This manual calculation ended up being unnecessary as I was able to follow
[Astro's reading time tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/reading-time/) with minimal difficulty. I was surprised that
the feature as implemented by this tutorial required a plugin for a system call Remark, but it's a minor complaint.

With the ability to calculate reading times in hand, I added reading times not only to the bylines of my posts, but also beside
the publication dates of the posts in the posts index, so that users can see a post's reading time before opening the post.

## External Link Icons

The other easy win in this changeset was the implementation of icons indicating external links, a change that I nabbed from
[Astro's external link icon tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/external-links/). I don't love the icon out of the box,
so I might change it later on.

As before, this change required a plugin, this time for a system called Rehype, which is not Remark,
the system that was used for the reading times.

I have since learned that:

* Remark is used to process Markdown.

* Rehype is used to process HTML.

* Both projects belong to a family of projects called Unified.

I have not learned why any of this was necessary to implement what I consider to be simple functionality.
I suspect that the justification is akin to the justification for middleware in web servers, where tasks that could
be simple to perform are performed in an external layer that is complex to integrate and modify for a reason
like separation of concerns or some other lofty ideal.

But again, I got the feature basically for free, so I suppose that I can't complain too much.

Although one problem with the code as it stands is that the icon may break to a new line. I feel like it's
fair to complain about that.

## Title Links

While writing this changeset I realised that I should make my post titles link to the
post when clicked on the home page. I clicked on a title expecting to visit the post and nothing happened.
So now post titles on the home page are links.

This did raise a question that I don't ponder too often: Should `h1` tags surround `a` tags or vice versa?
The consensus appears to be that either is fine, but to me it feels right for `h1` tags to be on the outside.
That would be consistent with the possibility of smaller headings where only part of the heading is a link,
although depending on how I implement links to subheading fragments that point may be moot. I also haven't
yet given thought to how the fragment links will be implemented. Maybe I'll use Remark or Rehype or some other
kind of Re.

## Footnotes

I wanted to make a comment about reading speeds but it felt like an aside that didn't fit in the flow of the post, so for the
first time in this blog I resorted to using a footnote. I mimicked a
[pattern for footnotes](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/reading-time/) which seems straightforward.
I wonder how often I'll be using footnotes and how much (or how little) my footnote style will evolve.

## Icon Inventory

I'm now using three kinds of icon in this blog:

1. My endmarks and separators (&#x2766;);

2. My external link indicators (&#x1f517;); and

3. My footnote return-to-post indicators (&#8617;).

I'm also expecting to use at least a fourth icon soon, to indicate subheading fragment links.

Right now these icons have no unifying principle beyond being Unicode characters, which would be a convenient
principle to preserve for the sake of the RSS feed, but I might be able to make more discerning
selections from the character set in future. In particular, emojis don't respect font colour like other characters do,
which is a point against using emojis.

That suits me just fine, because I don't need many reasons not to use emojis.

   1. Trying to pin down a single value for the average reading speed isn't simple.
   Some sources, including [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/91bd5526-e172-4436-bebb-cd988e91ea20), give a range of
   something like 200 to 250 words per minute or 200 to 300 words per minute,
   while [other sources](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X19300786) give the very specific
   value of 238 words per minute.
   The [default value of the reading-time plugin](https://github.com/ngryman/reading-time/blob/master/src/reading-time.ts#L101),
   which is the plugin that I'm using at the time of writing, is 200 words per minute.
