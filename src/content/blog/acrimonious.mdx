From a recent [Axios article about newspaper presidentail
endorsements](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/25/news-media-endorsements-president-2024-election):

<blockquote cite="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/25/news-media-endorsements-president-2024-election">
More than 200 publications owned by hedge fund Alden Global Capital, including the Chicago Tribune and Denver Post, declared in
2022 that they would no longer endorse national political candidates in their opinion pages, arguing the
public discourse "has become increasingly acrimonious."
</blockquote>

[Merriam-Webster defines "acrimonious"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acrimonious) as "angry and bitter".

Personally, I would prefer newspapers not to endorse politicians at any time. The current level of bitterness of
public discourse is irrelevant.
